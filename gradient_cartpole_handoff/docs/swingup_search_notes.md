# Swing-Up Search Notes

The current unsolved gap is capture, not only reachability. A direct cart-position trajectory probe can swing the exact hanging six-link chain into the upright angle threshold once:

```bash
make probe-swingup-trajectory
```

This writes:

runs/swingup6_trajectory_probe/probe.json
```

Expected zero-noise probe result:

- best max absolute angle is about `0.143 rad`, below the configured `0.15 rad` threshold,
- first upright event occurs around `3.52 s`,
- max upright streak is only one simulation step (`0.02 s`),
- the run is not successful and must not be used as evidence for a solved policy.

The probe is useful because it proves the configured MuJoCo system can physically reach the upright basin from the hanging state within the rail. The remaining work is to produce a low-velocity capture state or a stronger catch controller that can hold the chain upright for at least `5 s`, then validate it over held-out noisy starts.

Negative PPO probe with the corrected reward gate:

```

Final full-hanging eval from that bounded run remained `success_rate = 0.0`, `ever_upright_rate = 0.0`, and `max_upright_streak_mean = 0.0`. Later curriculum stages collapsed into short rail-hit episodes, so that checkpoint is not a solution artifact.
